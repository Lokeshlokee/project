  <h2>early <span>life</span></h2>
  <p>Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964
      the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Ted Jorgensen.[11] At the time of Jeff's birth,
      his mother was a 17-year-old high-school student and his father was 19 years old.
      Jorgensen was a Danish American unicyclist[13] born in Chicago to a family of Baptists.
      After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school,
      bringing her baby with her.[15] Jeff attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque when he was two years old. </p>
      
      <p>Ted Jorgensen drank and struggled financially.[17] Jacklyn left her husband to live with her parents,
          filing for divorce in June 1965 when Jeff was seventeen months old.[18]
</p>
<p>After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968.
  Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jeff, whose surname was then legally changed
  from Jorgensen to Bezos.[20] Gise, her husband and her son left the area and asked Jorgensen to
  discontinue contact, to which he agreed.
</p>
<p> After Mike had received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston,
  Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon.[22] Jeff attended River Oaks Elementary
  School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[23] Jeff's maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise,
  a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[24] Lawrence retired early
  to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Jeff would spend many summers in his youth.[25] Jeff would 
  ater purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres,
  Jeff displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency and once rigged an electric alarm to keep 
  his younger siblings out of his room.[28][29] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Jeff attended Miami Palmetto High School
  While Jeff was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.
</p>
<p>Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida.
  He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,and a Silver Knight 
  Award winner in 1982.[33] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he 
  dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted 
  his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge 
  national park".[35] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University 
  with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical
  engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa. While 
  at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.
  In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space</p>

  <p>In spring 1994, Bezos read that web usage was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and eventually decided to establish an online bookstore.[44] He and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage in Bellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[45][46] With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[47] Prior to settling in Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at an Indian reservation near San Francisco in order to avoid paying taxes.[48] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[49] At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[50] In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[50] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as an investment in Amazon.[46][51][52] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[53] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[43][49] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[54] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.
